# youtube

_A platform which give you info about the newest video on a channel._

**This uses web scraping, a better implementation will be to use the API.**

## __BREAKING CHANGE__

Video views and stars are now reported.  As a result any automations triggered by state will now be triggered when the number of views or stars changes.  To avoid this, add the url attribute to the trigger so that the automation is only triggered when the reported url changes ie:

``` yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.franck_nijhof
    attribute: url
```

## Installation

To get started put all the files from`/custom_components/youtube/` here:
`<config directory>/custom_components/youtube/`

## Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
sensor:
  platform: youtube
  channel_id: UCZ2Ku6wrhdYDHCaBzLaA3bw
```
